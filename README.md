Welcome! This is an example of a 'forth-like' interpreter written in Rust.
For those unaware, it's a language that uses RPL (Reverse Polish Notation) and is based on stack manipulations.

For example: 

`go-forth> 1 2 3 +`
Will result in `OK -> STACK [1, 5]`

This is primarily an exercise in language design. 
Not production quality code, but feel free to use however you'd like according to the license.
